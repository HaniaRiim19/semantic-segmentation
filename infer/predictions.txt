durganand jha and dharam dayal 	Facts
dharam dayal was a mere benamidar for hiranand jha 	Facts
on the 5th june  1916  bisheshwar dayal singh purchased six anna share in the lakhraj interest from deolal pathak and others and on the 9th february  1917  he purchased another two anna share from mandil pathak 	Facts
by virtue of these purchases he came to own the lakhraj interest to the extent of eight anna share 	Facts
he already held the mokarrari interest to the same extent which had devolved on him by inheritance 	Facts
some time in the year 1917 or 1918 hiranand jha and durganand jha  who had acquired by purchase two anna mokar  rari interest of madho saran singh  155 purchased in execution of a rent decree the raiyati interest in the whole village and came into possession of it 	Facts
they thus became mokarraridars of two anna share and raiyats of sixteen annas of the village lands 	Facts

these three khatians were allotted to bisheshwar dayal singh and in exchange for the remaining portions of his interest in that village he was given some property in village holeya 	Facts
the result of the partition proceedings was that the defendants  first party came to hold fourteen anna mokarrari interest in village  darha  bisheshwar dayal singh s interest was limited to three khatians only  and the jhas got a separate allotment for their two anna share in the mokarrari 	Facts
it appears that some time about the year 1926 the lakhraj interest holders  i e   the pathaks and bisheshwar dayal singh  were in default in the payment of the cess due to government 	Facts
on the 17th august  1926  pro  ceedings were taken against them for recovery of the cess and their interest was sold in execution of a certificate on the 18th october  1927  to one bijainandan sahay 	Facts
the sale obviously was of the lakhraj interest 	Facts
this was confirmed on the 19th december  1927  and a sale certificate was issued on the both march  1928 	Facts
this was followed by deliv  ery of possession on 15th july  1928 	Facts
possession was ob  tained by one kamta prasad who had acquired this interest from bijainandan sahay on the 20th april  1928 	Facts
on the 1st may  1933  kamta prasad transferred his interest in the village to the plaintiffs who thus became proprietors of sixteen anna share in the village and mokarraridars as to two anna 156 share and raiyats of the entire sixteen annas in the whole village 	Facts
on the 21st september  1934  the defendants  first party as mokarraridars brought a suit against the plaintiffs for arrears of raiyati rent for the years 1338 39 f  to the extent of six annas share and for the years 134041 f  to the extent of fourteen anna share claiming that under the parti  tion decree they got a fourteen anna share in the mokarrari interest in the village 	Facts
plaintiffs contested the suit alleging that bisheshwar s mokarrari interest had merged in the lakhraj interest that was purchased by him from the pathaks in the years 1916 17  and that by the sale under the government s certificate his whole eight anna interest in the village including both the lakhraj and the mokarrari had passed on to the plaintiffs and that the defendants  first party could only claim rent from them to the extent of the six anna share in the mokarrari 	Facts
this plea was disallowed and the defendants  first party s claim for rent was decreed in full 	Facts
the decree was upheld on appeal and second appeal 	Facts
the question of title was  however  left open 	Facts
in the year 1938 another suit for rent was filed by the defendants  first party as mokarraridars to recover fourteen anna share of the rent for the years subsequent to fasli 1341 	Facts
as a result of this suit  the plaintiffs brought the present suit for declaration and injunction on the allegation that the eight anna mokarrari interest of bisheshwar dayal singh had merged in his lakhraj interest  that by the certificate sale bisheshwar dayal singh lost all his interest in the village both lakhraj and mokarrari by reason of merger  that the partition decree of the year 1921 was illegal and in any case  under that decree the defendants  first party got only six anna mokarrari interest and were entitled to realize rents from the tenants only to that extent 	Facts
an injunction was also claimed restraining the defendants from proceeding with the rent suit 	Facts
in the plaint  it was alleged that there was a private partition between the mokarraridars by virtue of which the lands of village darha were divided between the three sets of mokarraridars  each set being 157 in separate possession of its own separate and defined shares 	Facts
it was also pleaded that there was another parti  tion between the proprietors of the lakhrai interest  that is  between bisheshwar dayal singh on the one hand and deolal pathak  neman pathak and surajnath pathak on the other  by virtue of which the lands that were in mokarrari patties of parmeshwar dayal singh and others and hiranand jha and durganand jha fell in the patti of deolal pathak and others  while  the lands that were in the mokarrari patti of the defendants  second party fell in his proprietary lakhraj patti and that as a result of these partitions the mokarrari interest of the defendants  second party merged in his lakhraj interest and under a certificate sale the whole of his interest passed to the plaintiffs 	Facts
the trial judge held that both the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 5 and 8 of their plaint were proved and that the mokarrari interest of bisheshwar dayal singh merged in his lakhraj interest and that at the certif  icate sale the purchaser acquired his complete interest both lakhraj and mokarrari along with the eight anna lakhraj interest of the pathaks and that the defendants  first party were mokarraridars of six anna interest in the village and to that extent were entitled to a decree in their rent suit and could not claim a decree for rent to the extent of fourteen anna share 	Facts
the high court in appeal held that none of the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs were proved and that the mokarrari interest of eight annas could not merge in the lakhrai interest of sixteen annas held jointly by bisheshwar dayal singh with the pathaks 	Ruling by Lower Court
as a result of this decision the plaintiffs  suit was dismissed 	Facts
in this appeal it was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the high court had erroneously held that the two partitions set up by the plaintiffs in para  graphs 5 and 8 had not been proved 	Argument
it was argued that the evidence on the record  both documentary and oral  fully established the fact of the two partitions and that in view of these partitions it should have been held that bisheshwar dayal singh 158 became separate owner of eight anna lakhraj interest and in that interest his mokarrari interest of eight annas merged  and that under the certificate sale the whole of this inter  est passed on to the purchaser in execution and that being so  the defendants  first party could only maintain a suit for recovery of rent from the raiyats to the extent of their six anna mokarrari interest 	Argument
in our opinion  this appeal can be disposed of on a short point without taking into consideration the respective contentions of the parties raised before us or urged in the two courts below 	Ratio of the decision
the plaintiffs  case rests solely on the allegation of merger of the eight anna lakhraj interest of bisheshwar dayal singh with his mokarrari interest to the same extent 	Facts
it  however  seems to us that there was no scope for the application of the doctrine of merger to the facts disclosed by the plaintiffs in their plaint 	Ratio of the decision
if the lessor purchases the lessee s interest  the lease no doubt is extinguished as the same man cannot at the same time be both a landlord and a tenant  but there is no extinction of the lease if one of the several lessees purchases only a part of the lessor s interest 	Ratio of the decision
in such a case the leasehold and the reversion cannot be said to coincide 	Ratio of the decision
it was the plaintiffs  case that mauza darha was orginally granted in mokarrari under a single contract of lease and it was by inheritance that the lessee s interest devolved on three branches of the family  bisheshwar dayal singh getting an interest of eight annas in the whole of the leasehold 	Ratio of the decision
he then purchased a six anna interest in the entire reversion in the year 1916 and another two anna interest in it in the year 1917 	Ratio of the decision
by these purchases he became a joint owner in the entire lakhraj holding to the extent of a moiety 	Ratio of the decision
he  however  never came to own the entire lakhraj interest in the village or the entire mokarrari interest therein 	Ratio of the decision
there was thus no coalescence of the interest of the lessor and the lessee in the whole of the estate which was subject to lakhraj and mokarrari interests and that being so  the mokarrari interest of bisheshwar dayal singh did not merge in his lakhrai interest 	Ratio of the decision
159 mere purchase by bisheshwar dayal singh of portions of the lakhrai interest could not bring about an extinction of the lease or break its integrity as he was only one of the several joint holders of the mokarrari interest 	Ratio of the decision
an inter se partition of the mokarrari interest amongst the mokarrari  dars as alleged by the plaintiffs could not affect their liability qua the lessor for the payment of the whole rent  as several tenants of a tenancy in law constitute but a single tenant  and qua the landlord they constitute one person  each constituent part of which possesses certain common rights in the whole and is liable to discharge common obligations in its entirety 	Ratio of the decision
in the words of lord halsbury in white v  tyndall 1   the parties to whom a demise is made hold as tenants in common but what they covenant to pay is one rent  not two rents and not each to pay half a rent but one rent 	Precedent
there is a privity of the estate between the tenant and the landlord in the whole of the leasehold and he is liable for all the covenants running with the land 	Precedent
in law  therefore  an inter se partition of the mokarrari interest could not affect the integrity of the lease and it could not be said that bisheshwar dayal singh under the alleged partition became a mokarraridar under another con  tract of lease 	Precedent
such partitions amongst several lessees inter se are usually made for convenience of enjoyment of the leasehold but they do not in any way affect the integri  ty of the tenancy or make each holder of an interest in it as a separate holder of a different tenancy 	Precedent
in the present case there was not even an allegation that the tenancy was severed and the several tenancies came into existence as a result of the partition qua the landlord 	Ratio of the decision
similarly the allegation of partition inter se among the several owners of the lakhraj holding could not in any way affect the integri  ty of the lease in the absence of an allegation of a fresh contract between the split up owners of the holding and the different owners in the mokarrari interest 	Ratio of the decision
the lakhraj holding in the village still remains a single holding and it was not alleged that it was split up in different holdings 	Ratio of the decision
 all owners  1  13 app 	Ratio of the decision
cas 	Ratio of the decision
263 21 160 of the lakhraj interest are jointly responsible for payment of the cess to government and it was because of their de  fault in payment of the cess that the whole lakhraj interest was sold in the certificate sale 	Ratio of the decision
in this situation none of the conditions necessary for the application of the doctrine of merger can be said to have been made out by the allega  tions made in the plaint 	Ratio of the decision
on the plaintiffs  own case the lease is still a live one in respect of the six anna inter  est of the defendants  first party and in these circum  stances it is not possible to hold that it has become ex  tinct to the extent of eight anna interest of bisheshwar dayal singh in the absence of any allegation that any fresh contract  express or implied  was arrived at between the parties 	Ratio of the decision
the leasehold has not in any way been drowned in the reversion and both lakhraj and mokarrari interest are still intact 	Precedent
for the reasons given above we agree with the decision of the high court that bisheshwar dayal singh s interest in the mokarrari did not merge in his lakhraj interest and that under the certificate sale it did not pass to the execution purchaser 	Ratio of the decision
on the other hand  it vested in the defendants  first party by reason of the family partition and they became entitled as mokarraridars to recover rent from the plaintiffs  raiyats to the extent of fourteen annas share 	Ratio of the decision
all that passed at the certificate sale to the execu  tion purchaser and subsequently to the plaintiffs was merely the lakhraj interest of the pathaks and of bisheshwar dayal singh and it could not be that at this sale qua one judg  ment debtor a larger interest passed to the execution pur  chaser than in respect of the other debtor 	Ratio of the decision
in view of our decision that the doctrine of merger has no application to the facts of the case  the plaintiffs  case is bound to fail 	Ratio of the decision
we accordingly hold that there is no substance in this appeal and we dismiss it with costs 	Ruling by Present Court
appeal dismissed 	Ruling by Present Court
